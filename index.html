    <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
    <p>Recently, I have been enjoying the TV reality series "The Traitors US" airing on the streaming 
        service <a href="https://www.peacocktv.com/">Peacock</a> in which former reality TV stars
        come together to basically play a real life game of Among Us. There are about 3-4 people chosen as 
        the <strong> traitors</strong>, where they have to "murder" the other contestants while going undetected. 
        The rest of the contestants are known as <strong> the faithfuls</strong>, where they try to figure out who 
        the traitors are and <strong>banish</strong> them through daily discussion. The most recent season that is 
        currently airing is season 4, which star well known contestants from Survivor, The Bachelor, and Love Island.
        The drama, suspense, and personality of contestants makes this season worth the watch. They're actually
        currently casting for a new season where contestants do not have to be a celebrity or known reality TV star.
        This would be an amazing opportunity to be on TV while simultaneously having fun in a new environment. Applications
        can be sent to their <a href="https://thetraitorsus.com/">casting website</a> where you can showcase your 
        personality and why you would be great on the show.
